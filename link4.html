<li><strong>Optical Storage Media</strong>: cDS and DVDs are described as optical storage Media laser 
    light is used to read data and to write data on a surface of a disk. The data is stored in pits and bumps. 
    There is some advantageds to using opticacl storage media. They hold way more information than floppy disks
    and aso they are less expensive than hard disk options.</li>
<li><strong>WIFI/Bluetooth</strong>: A WIFI is a wireless transmitter that recieves information from a network via is connection. 
    It converts the recived inforation into radio waves then transmitts them. A device receives radio waves through installed wireless 
    adapters which allow it to download information from a data source. Bluetooth sends and receives radio waves in a band of
     79 different frequencies. These frrequencies are all centrered around 2.45Ghz. Devices using bluetooth automatically find and 
     connect to eachother, but they don't interfere with other devices as they are on different frequencies and channels</li>
<li><strong>LANS</strong>: There are two types of LANS WLANS and LANS. WANS are used  where computers or networks are situated 
    a long distance away from eachother. A number of LANS joined together can form a WAN. The most common types of WAN include 
    the internet and the network of ATMS used by banks. WLANS are similar to WANS but there are no wires or cables involved. 
    They provide wireless comunications over short distances using raios and infrared signals instead of cables.</li>
<li><strong>Network security</strong>: When accessing the internet users have to be very careful of many not obvious issues. 
    There are many sites on the internet that might be prone to interenet hacking or stealing of information.</li>

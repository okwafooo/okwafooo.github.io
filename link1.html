    <ul>
    <li><strong>Hubs</strong>: Hubs are hardware devices that can have a number of devices or computers connected to them.
         They are normally used to connect together a number of devices to form a LAN. Such as a star netwrok and its main task 
         is to take any data packet received at one of its ports and broadcasts it to every computer in the network.</li>
    <li><strong>Switches</strong>: Switches are similar to hubs but are much more efficient in the way that they distribute data 
        packets.
         Switches connect a number of devices and computers to a LAN. Unlike a hub a switch checks the packet received and works out 
         the destination.</li>
    <li><strong>Bridges</strong>: bridges are devices that connect one LAN to anotehr LAN. They are often used to connect different 
        parts of a 
        LAN to be used as a single LAN</li>
    <li><strong>Router</strong>: Routers enable data packets to be routed between different networks, for example for a LAn to join a 
        WAN(wide area network)</li>
    </ul>

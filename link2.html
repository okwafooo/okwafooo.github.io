<li><strong>Data packets</strong>: The data carried in a packet according to which protocol is used packets of data usually contain the following information</li>
<li>Some form of header to identify data packets</li>
<li>the senders IP address</li>
<li>The receivers IP address</li>
<li>how many data packets make up the ''whole message''</li>
<li>Identity number of each packet.</li>
<li><strong>Gateways</strong>: a gateway is a network point that acts as an entrance to another network. It is a key point for data on its way to and from. 
    If a network point needs to communicate outside its network it uses a gateway.</li>
<li><strong>Network cables</strong>: Even though most computyer systems use wifi, network 
    cables ares till used as they are faster and can be more secure than WIFI networks</li>
<li><strong>Backing up data</strong>: Backing up refers to the copying of files to a different disk or flash drive. Backing up data regularly is seen as a good computing practice 
    You should back up data to safeguard against loss of information maybe due to a failure of a storage device. This failure could be due to hardware reasons. 
    Backups can also be made in case files need to be used elseware.</li>
